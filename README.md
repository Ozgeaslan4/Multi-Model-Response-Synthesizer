Multi-Model Response Synthesizer
Overview
The Multi-Model Response Synthesizer is a Python project that interacts with multiple large language models (LLMs) to generate a refined, high-quality response to a userâ€™s query. It leverages asynchronous programming to optimize the process, gathering responses from various models and combining them using an aggregator model.

Features
Fetches a list of available language models via an API.
Sends user prompts to multiple models concurrently using asyncio and aiohttp for efficiency.
Synthesizes responses from different models using an advanced aggregator model.
Handles API rate limiting and retries intelligently.
Installation
Clone the repository:

bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/multi-model-response-synthesizer.git
cd multi-model-response-synthesizer
Install the required dependencies:

bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
Add your API key and API URL:

Open the script and replace API_KEY and API_URL with your own.
Usage
Run the script:

bash
python synthesize_responses.py
The script will fetch available models, send user queries, and aggregate the responses into a single, high-quality output.

Example
python
user_prompt = "How can I make a cake?"
The script will send this prompt to the models, collect their responses, and synthesize the final answer using the aggregator model.
